# Preface {-}

The dashboards project is a project at FHI concerned with running automated analyses on data. An automated analysis is any analysis that:

1. Will be repeated multiple times in the future
2. Always has an input dataset with consistent file structure
3. Always has the same expected output (e.g. tables, graphs, reports)
